<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
This website is currently not completed but I am getting there, I promise. <br> You can check a preview here: <a href="https://main.d2y8039xkthxm4.amplifyapp.com/">Portfolio</a>.<br>
I have been trying to build this project with more than a language in order to show my skills as much as possible. 
It was also very important to show my personality through it, so you will find small pieces of me around it, together with some useful information if you want to get in touch or talk about a collaboration. <br>
The hero illustration has been created by the artist <a href="https://francescaquinzi.wordpress.com">Francesca Quinzi</a> .
